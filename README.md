IdeaNexus is a streamlined SaaS platform for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) to systematically capture, evaluate, and implement innovative ideas. Built following lean startup principles, it addresses unstructured innovation processes in South African SMEs. Powered by Nuxt 4, Nuxt UI components, Clerk authentication, and SQLite for the MVP.

For detailed project context, see the [memory-bank/projectbrief.md](memory-bank/projectbrief.md) and other documentation files.

## Quick Start

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/ideanexus.git  # Replace with actual repo URL
cd ideanexus
pnpm install
```

Set up environment variables (see Setup section below), then start the development server.

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:

```
CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
# Add other vars as needed (e.g., DATABASE_URL for future migrations)
```

- Get Clerk keys from your [Clerk dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com).
- For development, use test keys; switch to live for production.

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Note: Authentication is required for protected routes (e.g., dashboard). Sign up/login via Clerk to test.

## Core Features (MVP)

The MVP focuses on essential innovation lifecycle management:

| Feature | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Idea Submission Portal | Simple form for title, description, benefits, and submitter info | Planned |
| Idea Repository | Searchable database of submitted ideas | Planned |
| Basic Evaluation Framework | Scoring on impact, feasibility, resources | Planned |
| Status Tracking | Visual board for idea progression (submitted â†’ implemented) | Planned |
| Email Notifications | Automated updates on submissions and status changes | Planned |
| Simple Analytics Dashboard | Metrics on idea flow, approvals, implementation times | Planned |
