# Product Context - IdeaNexus

## Why This Project Exists

IdeaNexus addresses a critical gap in the South African SME market: the lack of structured innovation management systems. Most small and medium businesses struggle with:

- **Scattered Innovation Efforts**: Ideas get lost in emails, meetings, and informal conversations
- **No Systematic Evaluation**: Good ideas die due to lack of proper assessment frameworks
- **Resource Waste**: Time and money spent on poorly vetted concepts
- **Missed Opportunities**: Valuable innovations never see implementation
- **Lack of Transparency**: Innovation processes are opaque and inconsistent

## Problems We Solve

### Primary Problem
SMEs lose competitive advantage because they cannot systematically capture, evaluate, and implement innovative ideas from their teams.

### Secondary Problems
1. **Innovation Bottlenecks**: Ideas pile up without clear progression paths
2. **Evaluation Inconsistency**: Different stakeholders use different criteria
3. **Poor Resource Allocation**: No data-driven approach to innovation investment
4. **Team Disengagement**: Contributors don't see what happens to their ideas
5. **Strategic Misalignment**: Ideas don't connect to business objectives
